# CodeQuiz

I created a timed code quiz using javascript, html, and css.

The coding quiz is timed with multiple choice questions. It runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

I started by creating the layout in html and css, and then created funtionality in the js file. 

I created the button first, then started with the questions and answers. I used if else statements to subtract time from the clock when a question was answered incorrectly.
